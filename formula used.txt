the formulae are as follows; follow Indian Standard code of practice
FOR Slab weight= (area of slab)*(characteristic strength of concrete)*(thickness of slab)


FOR Column Weight=(area of column)*(characteristic strength of concrete)*(No. of columns)*(height of each floor)


FOR Beam Weight:
Beams in x-axis=(area of beam)*(characteristic strength of concrete)*(No. of beams)*(total length of plan in x-axis)
Beams in y-axis=(area of beam)*(characteristic strength of concrete)*(No. of beams)*(total length of plan in y-axis)
Total Beam Weight= [(Beams in x-axis) + (Beams in y-axis)]


FOR Wall Weight:
Wall in x-axis=(wall thickness*length of plan in x-axis*height of each floor)*(characteristic strength of masonry brick)
Wall in y-axis=(wall thickness*length of plan in y-axis*height of each floor)*(characteristic strength of masonry brick)
Total Wall Weight= (Wall in x-axis) + (Wall in y-axis)


FOR Live load=(0.25)*(Given input of Live load)*(Total area of slab);


LOAD ON EACH FLOOR=(Slab weight)+(Beam Weight)+(Column Weight)+(Wall Weight)+(Live Load Weight);


LOAD ON ROOF SLAB=(Slab Weight)+(Beam Weight)+(Column Weight/2)+(Wall Weight/2);


TOTAL Weight=[LOAD ON EACH FLOOR*(No. of floors - 1)]+[LOAD ON ROOF SLAB].



Use the following standard values:
characteristic strength of concrete=25kN/m^2, characteristic strength of masonry brick=20kN/m^2.
For length of wall: multiply the dimension centre to centre distance between two columns and height of each floor.
For beam area: eliminate the area of beam present within the slab by multiplying the width of beam with the difference of depth of beam and slab thickness.
